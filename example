The above websites clearly explained clearly.

Now, let me explain the logic of using the dynamic block:

First you need to replace the “identity” with dynamic “identity” to let Terraform knows that this will be used dynamically.
Next, configure the conditional expression. Let me break down the one we’ve used.:
for_each = var.managed_identity_enable == true ? [1] : [ ]
This conditional expression is a combination of ‘for_each’ loop with ‘if’ condition.

if_condition — “var.managed_identity_enable == true ? [1] : [ ]”

‘?’ operator signifies that the condition is true, and it returns ‘for_each = [1]’ (a single element).

‘:’ operator represents the else case, which means the condition is false, and it returns ‘for_each = []’ (an empty list).

‘for_each’ — Then, it executes the dynamic block for each element in the list. If ‘for_each’ is set to [1], it will execute the dynamic block; if it’s an empty list, it will skip the block.

Now, Let’s see dynamic block in action:
